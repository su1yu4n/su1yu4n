# About
Hi, I‚Äôm ÈöèÁºò (su1yu4n). I'm a member of[@Nepnep](https://ctftime.org/team/106104) and [@XDSEC](https://github.com/XDSEC).  \
I‚Äôm interested in **mathematics**, **cryptology**(especially public key cryptography) and computer science. \
**I'm currently learning complex analysis and studying a problem related to the distribution of quadratic residues.**

# Programming Languages Skills
- C
- python / sagemath

# Math and Crypto Skills
- I'm familiar with:
  - Basic calculus
  - Basic linear algebra
  - **Elementary number theory**
  - **Basic abstract algebra**
  - **Classic modern cryptography schemes** ,including well-known cryptanalysis on these schemes

- I've learned something about (familiarty from high to low): 
  - **Compact Riemann Surfaces**
  - **Elliptic curves (in) cryptography, also some isogeny based crypto**
  - Algorithmic number theory
  - General topology (and a bit of algebraic topology encountered when learning Riemann surfaces)
  - **Provable Security**
  - Complex analysis
  - Homomorphic Encryption (Pallier-DJN, TFHE, ...)
  - cryptography in FL and PPML (HE and secure aggregation)

- I'm learning or studying:
  - **distribution of quadratic residues**
 
- I've planned to learn:
  - more lattice based crypto
  - Algebraic number theory (related to ideal lattice and more crypto)
  - Arakelov geometry

  *By the way, I've uploaded [my mini course on algebra and number theory for cryptography](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16F411377F) to bilibili (present in Chinese). I've uploaded a series of Elliptic Curves also.(but there are some mistakes and important things not covered or pointed out in this series)*
