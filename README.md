# About
Hi, I’m @su1yu4n / 随缘. I'm a member of the CTF team @Nepnep. \
I’m interested in **modern mathematics**, **cryptology**(especially public key cryptography) and knowledge about underlying computer system. \
I’m currently reading the Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves(GTM106), the algebraic number theory part in Napkin and papers on FHE. \
I like Vocaloid songs a lot and I've been collecting of nice songs on bilibili. [Here](https://space.bilibili.com/486203906/favlist?fid=1416101706)'s a collection of the best songs I've ever heard. [Here](https://space.bilibili.com/486203906/favlist?fid=1439638306)'s another nice collection
