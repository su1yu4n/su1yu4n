# About
Hi, I’m 随缘(su1yu4n). I'm a member of[@Nepnep](https://ctftime.org/team/106104) and [@XDSEC](https://github.com/XDSEC).  \
I’m interested in **mathematics**, **cryptology**(especially public key cryptography) and computer science. \
~I’m currently preparing for watching my friend's presentations about automorphic representation.~  \
~I’m currently learning attacks about SIDH/SIKE and other things about isogeny based crypto.~ \
(2023.7) **I'm currently studying ideal lattice and some real world cryptography.**

\

*I love music (especially some nice Vocaloid songs) and I've been collecting some nice songs on bilibili.*

# Programming Languages Skills
- C
- python3 / sagemath

# Mathematics Skills
- I'm familiar with:
  - Basic calculus
  - Basic linear algebra
  - **Elementary number theory**
  - **Basic abstract algebra**


- I've learned a bit about (familiarty from high to low): 
  - **Compact Riemann Surfaces**
  - Algorithmic number theory
  - Elliptic curves in cryptography, especially isogeny based crypto
  - Topology (including some AT related to compact R.S.)
  - Complex analysis
  - Algebraic number theory
  - Differentiable manifolds
  


- I'm learning or prepare to learn:
  - Algebraic number theory (related to ideal lattice and more crypto)
  - Complex analysis
  - ~Algebraic curves~
  - ~Modular forms~

  *By the way, I've uploaded [my mini course on algebra and number theory for cryptography](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16F411377F) to bilibili (present in Chinese). I've uploaded something about Elliptic Curves also.*
