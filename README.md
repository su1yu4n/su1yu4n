# About
Hi, I’m @su1yu4n / 随缘. I'm a member of[@Nepnep](https://ctftime.org/team/106104) and [@XDSEC](https://github.com/XDSEC).  \
I’m interested in **modern mathematics**, **cryptology**(especially public key cryptography) and knowledge about computer system. \
~I’m currently preparing for watching my friend's presentations about automorphic representation.~  \
**I’m currently learning attacks about SIDH/SIKE and other things about isogeny based crypto.**

*I love Vocaloid music and I've been collecting some nice songs on bilibili.*

# Programming Languages Skills
- C
- Python3
- Sagemath

# Mathematics Skills
- I'm familiar with:
  - Basic calculus
  - Basic linear algebra
  - **Elementary number theory**
  - **Basic abstract algebra**


- I've learnt a bit about (familiarty from high to low): 
  - **Riemann Surfaces**
  - Algorithmic number theory
  - General topology
  - Complex analysis
  - Differentiable manifolds
  - Algebraic number theory


- I'm learning or prepare to learn:
  - ~Algebraic number theory~
  - ~Algebraic curves~
  - **Elliptic curves in cryptography, especially isogeny based crypto**
  - **Riemann surfaces**
  - Modular forms

  *By the way, I've uploaded [my mini course on algebra and number theory for cryptography](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16F411377F) to bilibili (present in Chinese). I've uploaded something about Elliptic Curves also.*
