# About
Hi, I’m 随缘(su1yu4n). I'm a member of[@Nepnep](https://ctftime.org/team/106104) and [@XDSEC](https://github.com/XDSEC).  \
I’m interested in **mathematics**, **cryptology**(especially public key cryptography) and computer science. \
~I’m currently preparing for watching my friend's presentations about automorphic representation.~  \
~I’m currently learning attacks about SIDH/SIKE and other things about isogeny based crypto.~ \
(2023.7) **I'm currently studying ideal lattice and some real world cryptography.**
(2023.8) I'm currently touching fish...

*I love music (especially some nice Vocaloid songs) and I've been collecting some nice songs on bilibili.*

# Programming Languages Skills
- C
- python / sagemath


# Mathematics Skills
- I'm familiar with:
  - Basic calculus
  - Basic linear algebra
  - **Elementary number theory**
  - **Basic abstract algebra**


- I've learned something about (familiarty from high to low): 
  - **Compact Riemann Surfaces**
  - Algorithmic number theory
  - Elliptic curves in cryptography, especially isogeny based crypto
  - General topology (and a bit of algebraic topology encountered when learning Riemann surfaces.)
  - Complex analysis


- I'm learning or prepare to learn:
  - Algebraic number theory (related to ideal lattice and more crypto)
  - Arakelov geometry


  *By the way, I've uploaded [my mini course on algebra and number theory for cryptography](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16F411377F) to bilibili (present in Chinese). I've uploaded a series of Elliptic Curves also.(but there are some mistakes and important things not covered or pointed out in this series)*
