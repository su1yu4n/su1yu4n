# About
Hi, I’m @su1yu4n / 随缘. I'm a member of[@Nepnep](https://ctftime.org/team/106104) and [@XDSEC](https://github.com/XDSEC).  \
I’m interested in **modern mathematics**, **cryptology**(especially public key cryptography) and knowledge about underlying computer system. \
**I’m currently preparing for watching my friend's presentations about automorphic representation.**
\
I love Vocaloid music and I've been collecting some nice songs on bilibili. [Here](https://space.bilibili.com/486203906/favlist?fid=1416101706)'s a collection of the best songs I've ever heard.

# Programming Languages Skills
- C
- Python3
- Sagemath

# Mathematics Skills
- I'm familiar with:
  - Basic calculus
  - Basic linear algebra
  - **Elementary number theory**
  - **Abstract algebra**
- I've learnt something about: 
  - Point set topology
  - Complex analysis
  - Differentiable manifolds
  - **Riemann Surfaces**
  - **Algorithmic number theory** 
- I'm stilling learning:
  - Algebraic number theory
  - Algebraic curves
  - **Elliptic curves in cryptography**
  - Algorithmic number theory 

  *By the way, I've uploaded [my mini course on algebra and number theory for cryptography](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16F411377F) to bilibili (present in Chinese). I've uploaded something about Elliptic Curves also.*
