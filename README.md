# About
Hi, I‚Äôm su1yu4n (ÈöèÁºò). <!-- I'm a member of[@Nepnep](https://ctftime.org/team/106104) and [@XDSEC](https://github.com/XDSEC). -->

I‚Äôm interested in **mathematics** and **cryptology**(including both theory and practice, especially public key cryptography).

**I'm currently focusing on CSIDH, an isogeny based key exchange scheme.** 
I'm also learning Rust programming language.

# Programming Languages Skills
- C
- python / sagemath

# Math and Crypto Skills
- I'm familiar with:
  - Basic calculus
  - Basic linear algebra
  - **Elementary number theory**
  - **Basic abstract algebra**
  - **Some everyday Cryptography schemes**, including some well-known cryptanalysis on these schemes

- I've learned something about (familiarty from high to low): 
  - some knowledge of Elliptic curves (in) cryptography, also some isogeny based crypto
  - Compact Riemann Surfaces
  - Homomorphic Encryption (Pallier-DJN, TFHE, ...)


- I'm learning or studying:
  - **isogeny based cryptography (especially CSIDH)** 
  - Rust


- I've planned to learn:
  - more math and computation related to isogeny based crypto, e.g.
    - improved attacks on SIDH (since Castryck-Decru attack)
    - some usage of pairing
    - new algorithm: Clapotti

  *By the way, I've uploaded [my mini course on algebra and number theory for cryptography](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16F411377F) to bilibili (present in Chinese). I've uploaded a series of Elliptic Curves also.(but there are some flaws and important things not covered or pointed out in this series)*
